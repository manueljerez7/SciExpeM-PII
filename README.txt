Pernici, Barbara

The project done is related to the Polimi Project SciExpEm.
On the documentation, a brief introduction to this project is explained, as well as the task I was requested to do and my solutions proposed.

There are no prototypes of the project as I was requested some Python functions to do.
I prepared a GitHub repository with all the job done, with some scripts that can be executed to test the functions and see possible outputs.
